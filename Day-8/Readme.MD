# Day 8: ES6+ Features

This is a lesson plan outline for day 8 of a coding class that covers some of the exciting new features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and beyond. These features enhance the capabilities and readability of JavaScript code.

**Tasks/Activities**

- **Activity 1: Template Literals**

  - **Task 1: String Interpolation**

    - Create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age.
    - Use template literals (backticks) to embed these variables within the string and log the result to the console.

  - **Task 2: Multi-line Strings**
    - Demonstrate the creation of a multi-line string using template literals, avoiding the need for concatenation.
    - Log the multi-line string to the console.

- **Activity 2: Destructuring**

  - **Task 3: Object Destructuring**

    - Create a book object with properties like title and author.
    - Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from the object and log them to the console.

  - **Task 4: Array Destructuring**
    - Create an array of numbers.
    - Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from the array and log them to the console.

- **Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators**

  - **Task 5: Spread Operator**

    - Create an existing array of numbers.
    - Use the spread operator (...) to create a new array that includes all elements of the existing array along with additional elements.
    - Log the new array to the console.

  - **Task 6: Rest Operator**
    - Write a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments using the rest operator (...).
    - Inside the function, calculate the sum of all arguments and return the result.
    - Call the function with different numbers of arguments and log the results.

- **Activity 4: Default Parameters**

  - **Task 7: Function with Default Parameter**
    - Define a function that takes two parameters: one for a number and a second one (optional) with a default value of 1.
    - The function should calculate the product of the two numbers.
    - Call the function with and without providing the second argument, and log the results to demonstrate the default behavior.

- **Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals**

  - **Task 8: Object with Methods**

    - Use enhanced object literals to create an object with properties and methods.
    - Define a method within the object that utilizes the object's properties.
    - Log the entire object to the console.

  - **Task 9: Computed Property Names**
    - Create an object with computed property names based on variables.
    - Log the object to the console to see the dynamic property names.

**Feature Request (Optional)**

Consider creating scripts or exercises to solidify understanding of these features:

1. **Template Literals Script:** Write a script that demonstrates string interpolation, multi-line strings, and potentially formatted output using template literals.
2. **Destructuring Script:** Create a script that uses both object and array destructuring to extract values from complex data structures.
3. **Spread and Rest Operators Script:** Write a script that showcases the spread operator for copying arrays and combining them, and the rest operator for handling variable function arguments.
4. **Default Parameters Script:** Create a script that defines functions with various default parameters and explores how they influence function calls.
5. **Enhanced Object Literals Script:** Write a script that utilizes enhanced object literals to create objects with methods, computed property names, and potentially shorthand property definitions.

**Achievement**

By the end of these activities, students will be able to:

- Craft clear and concise strings using template literals for variable interpolation and multi-line content.
- Extract values efficiently from objects and arrays through destructuring.
- Utilize the spread operator for array manipulation and the rest operator for handling variable function arguments.
- Define functions with default parameters to provide flexibility in function calls.
- Create objects using enhanced object literals, including methods and computed property names, for cleaner and more expressive code.
